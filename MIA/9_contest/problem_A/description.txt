input: standard input
output: standard output

As you could know there are no male planes nor female planes.
However, each plane on Earth likes some other plane. There are n planes on Earth, numbered from 1 to n,
and the plane with number i likes the plane with number fi, where 1 ≤ fi ≤ n and fi ≠ i.

We call a love triangle a situation in which plane A likes plane B,
plane B likes plane C and plane C likes plane A.
Find out if there is any love triangle on Earth.

Input:
The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 5000) — the number of planes.

The second line contains n integers f1, f2, ..., fn (1 ≤ fi ≤ n, fi ≠ i), meaning that the i-th plane likes the fi-th.

Output:
Output «YES» if there is a love triangle consisting of planes on Earth. 
Otherwise, output «NO».

You can output any letter in lower case or in upper case.eger type.
