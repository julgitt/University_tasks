A. Mirror in the String
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 256 megabytes
input: standard input
output: standard output

You have a string s1 s2… sn
and you stand on the left of the string looking right.
You want to choose an index k (1≤k≤n) and place a mirror after the k-th letter,
so that what you see is s1 s2… sk sk sk−1… s1. 

What is the lexicographically smallest string you can see?

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b
if and only if one of the following holds:

- a is a prefix of b, but a≠b;
- in the first position where a and b differ,
 the string a has a letter that appears earlier
in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. 

Input:
The first line of input contains one integer t
(1≤t≤10000): the number of test cases.

The next t lines contain the description of the test cases,
two lines per a test case.

In the first line you are given one integer n
(1≤n≤105): the length of the string.

The second line contains the string s
consisting of n lowercase English characters.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n
over all test cases does not exceed 105.


Output:
For each test case print the lexicographically smallest string you can see.
