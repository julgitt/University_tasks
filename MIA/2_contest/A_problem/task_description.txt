There are n consecutive seat places in a railway carriage.
Each place is either empty or occupied by a passenger.

The university team for the Olympiad consists of a student-programmers and b student-athletes. Determine the largest number of students from all a+b
students, which you can put in the railway carriage so that:

no student-programmer is sitting next to the student-programmer;
and no student-athlete is sitting next to the student-athlete.
In the other words, there should not be two consecutive (adjacent) places where two student-athletes or two student-programmers are sitting.

Consider that initially occupied seat places are occupied by jury members (who obviously are not students at all).

Input:
The first line contain three integers n, a and b
(1≤n≤2*105, 0≤a,b≤2*105, a+b>0) 
— total number of seat places in the railway carriage,
the number of student-programmers and the number of student-athletes.

The second line contains a string with length n,
consisting of characters "." and "*".
The dot means that the corresponding place is empty.
The asterisk means that the corresponding place is occupied by the jury member.

Output:
Print the largest number of students, which you can put in the railway carriage so that no student-programmer is sitting next to a student-programmer and no student-athlete is sitting next to a student-athlete.
