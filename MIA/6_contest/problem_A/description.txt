Input:
The first line contains a single integer n
(1 ≤ n ≤ 418) — the number of integers.

Then n lines follow,
the i-th of which contains a single integer yi.

Each of these numbers has between 2 and 100 digits '0' through '9'. 
They can contain leading zeroes.

Output:
Output n lines.
For each i, output the following.
If it is possible to rearrange the digits of yi such that the resulting number is divisible by 60, 
output "red" (quotes for clarity). 
Otherwise, output "cyan".
